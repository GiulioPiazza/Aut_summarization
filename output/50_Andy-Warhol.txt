Andy Warhol: Why the great Pop artist thought ‘Trump is sort of cheap
He anticipated celebrity culture and social media, thought artists should do more than just hold a paintbrush, and wound up John Lennon. As a new Tate exhibition opens, Alastair Smart shows how far the most important artist of the modern age was ahead of his time
Reaction on social media was swift, widespread and mostly containing the word “bizarre”. Why show a low-action clip from 1982, of an artist who died in 1987, at a sporting showcase in 2019? What financial sense did it make also – given that advertising slots at the Super Bowl are the most expensive in the world, costing $175,000 a second
The answer is that the footage showed a great American artist eating a great American food in the context of a great American occasion. Burger King said the advert was a celebration of the country itself
Soon he was silk-screening images of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley too. It suggested an artist entirely at one with America’s average Joe. The irony is, of course, that under the current president’s administration, Warhol’s parents probably wouldn’t have been allowed into the United States in the first place. Andrej and Julia Warhola hailed from a tiny village called Mikova on the edge of the Carpathian Mountains, in what today is Slovakia (but in their day was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire). In search of a better life, they moved to Pittsburgh after the First World War, where Andrej worked in construction and where Andy – Andrew Warhola – was born in 1928
The Tate exhibition sets out to show how large an influence Warhol has had on artists after him, especially in the way he embraced different media and means of distribution. In the mid-1960s, after the early burst of Pop works, he took to making films, such as Sleep, in which his friend, the poet John Giorno, can be seen sleeping for five hours
In short, he believed an artist could, and should, do more than just hold a paintbrush. An interdisciplinary approach to art is today taken as standard – and that’s in no small part thanks to the example set by Warhol’s adventures decades ago
His influence extends far beyond the art world, though. “Warhol both predates and predicts the society we live in,” says Muir. On show at Tate Modern will be 25 paintings from a little-known series of paintings from 1975 called Ladies and Gentlemen. It depicts drag queens and trans women who frequented the Gilded Grape bar, off Times Square – and, in Muir’s view, “could easily pass for having been made yesterday, in terms of the debates being had now around trans identity and LGBT rights”
With these words, Warhol predicted the coming both of reality TV stars and social media influencers – as the platforms to achieve quick-fire celebrity grew exponentially
“It’s often said Warhol was the most important artist of the second half of the 20th century,” Muir says. “But one might well argue he’s the most important artist of the early 21st century too.” In a consumerist society, he realised that celebrities are every bit as ubiquitous and disposable as soup cans, Coke bottles and Burger King Whoppers
