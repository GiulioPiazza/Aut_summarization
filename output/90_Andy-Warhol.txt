Andy Warhol: Why the great Pop artist thought ‘Trump is sort of cheap
In short, he believed an artist could, and should, do more than just hold a paintbrush. An interdisciplinary approach to art is today taken as standard – and that’s in no small part thanks to the example set by Warhol’s adventures decades ago
His influence extends far beyond the art world, though. “Warhol both predates and predicts the society we live in,” says Muir. On show at Tate Modern will be 25 paintings from a little-known series of paintings from 1975 called Ladies and Gentlemen. It depicts drag queens and trans women who frequented the Gilded Grape bar, off Times Square – and, in Muir’s view, “could easily pass for having been made yesterday, in terms of the debates being had now around trans identity and LGBT rights”
